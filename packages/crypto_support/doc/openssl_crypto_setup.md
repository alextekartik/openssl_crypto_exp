OpenSSL libraries must be available for the implementation to work.

### Linux Setup

One time action to make `libcrypto.so` available

```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

### MacOS Setup

OpenSSL can be installed using brew. Ok it is version 3 but that looks compatible so far

```
brew install openssl
```
